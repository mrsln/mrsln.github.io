Recently I used AWS SAM on a job and in my pet project. I haven’t worked on the
backend side of things for a while and it was a nice way to create infrastructure
compared to things I was dealing with before. In this blurb I’m going to describe
my early experience with creating infrastructure and writing some business logic.

## What is it?

AWS SAM lets you declaratively describe infrastructure.

## Resource types

SAM lets you create a bunch of resources that will cover needs most of the web apps:

- Lambda for running code
- Databases
- File storage
- Queue
- CDN

<FullCode code={AllResourcesExample} />

## Serverless functions

Lambda is the most important building brick that runs the business logic and
becomes a glue between other resources. For me, the definition of a lambda
usually looks like this:

```yaml
Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
Properties:
  Handler: src/my-fun.handler
  Runtime: nodejs14.x
```

And the src/my-fun.js would look something like this

```yaml
exports.handler = async (event, context) => { }
```

### Triggers

Lambda can be used in various ways:

- Creating Rest API
- Handling Queue messages
- Handling CDN redirects
- Reacting to file uploads
- Reacting to table row changes

#### Rest API

```yaml
Events:
  <ArbitraryId>:
    Type: Api
    Properties:
      Path: /<path>
      Method: post
```

Few lines of config lets you add a REST API method. Behind the scenes it
creates API Gateway that configured to call your Lambda function. Now your
web client or other services can invoke the function using HTTP and get a reply.

### Queue

```yaml
Events:
  <ArbitraryId>:
    Type: SQS
    Properties:
      Queue: !Ref MyQueue
```

This means that your function will be invoked with a message that came to
MyQueue queue. It’s helpful for creating loosely coupled systems and for
handling jobs that take too much time to be handled during a REST request.

### CDN

```yaml
<ArbitraryId>:
  Type: AWS::CloudFront::Distribution
  Properties:
    DistributionConfig:
      DefaultCacheBehavior:
        LambdaFunctionAssociations:
          - EventType: viewer-request
            LambdaFunctionARN: !Ref RedirectLambdaFunction.Version
```

You can configure CloudFront to call your lambda in case of a file missing
in S3 bucket. This is useful for creating files lazily. Note, that this is not
Event property but rather configured on the CloudFront config.

### S3

```yaml
Events:
  <ArbitraryId>:
    Type: S3
    Properties:
      Bucket: !Ref <BucketId>
      Events: s3:ObjectCreated:*
```

You should rather rely on S3 triggering your function upon upload completion
than your web client. This is useful when you need to create a database entry
for the uploaded file or you need to process the file.

### DynamoDB

```yaml
Events:
  <ArbitraryId>:
    Type: DynamoDB
    Properties:
      Stream:
        "Fn::GetAtt":
          - <TableId>
          - StreamArn
      StartingPosition: TRIM_HORIZON
      BatchSize: 100
```

Triggering a Lambda function on changing DynamoDB table might be useful for
creating loosely coupled system but also I saw a case when it was used in
conjunction with TTL in order to calculate a new state of an entity.

## Things I missed

It’s easy to start using Lambda and quickly create business value. Having said
that I would love to see some improvements that will help developers create
modern scalable solutions from the get go.

### Native Typescript

I have used javascript for my pet project but for the system in anger I used
Typescript. Typescript lets you write scalable code that can be supported by future teams.
At the time of implementing my projects, there wasn’t an official approach to this.
Recently, AWS published a blog [post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-typescript-projects-with-aws-sam-cli/)
that describes the new built-in way of doing it. If I were you, I'd start there.

But if you want to follow your own way, you can transpile Typescript using bundlers
like Webpack. In particular, I was using this
[tutorial](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/serverless-typescript-a-complete-setup-for-aws-sam-lambda).
I like that this approach only uses public SAM API and doesn’t lock all your
Lambdas to Typescript.

Also, there are projects, rather opinionated ones, that let you use one command
to build everything like [this one](https://github.com/graphboss/aws-sam-webpack-plugin).

### Not the latest Node.js version

One of the surprising things for me was the fact that AWS Lambda doesn’t support
the latest version of NodeJS but only 14th and 10th versions. This is not a big
deal but it caught me off guard when my code failed because of usage of newer
ECMA syntax.

## Database

Every app needs to have a way to store data permanently. Luckily AWS SAM lets
you describe infra resources to store data in relational database, as well as
NoSQL solution.

### NoSQL – DynamoDB

```yaml
<ArbitraryId>:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable
  Properties:
    PrimaryKey:
      Name: <ArbitraryId>
      Type: String
```

Used it a couple of times. Cheap & fast.

### File Storage

```yaml
<Name>:
  Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
  Properties:
    BucketName: <ArbitraryIdIfNeeded>
    CorsConfiguration:
      CorsRules:
        - AllowedHeaders:
            - "*"
          AllowedMethods:
            - GET
            - PUT
            - POST
          AllowedOrigins:
            - "*"
          MaxAge: "3600"
```

Simple Storage Service is a service that I used on every project I that was
powered by AWS. Not surprisingly, in both projects users were uploading media
files and a lambda was processing them.

### CDN

```yaml
<ArbitraryId>:
  Type: AWS::CloudFront::Distribution
  Properties:
```

Then, you can create a subdomain for the bucket that is human-readable (e.g.
files.marsel.name) and loosely coupled (e.g. you can point it to Azure Blob
Storage in the future).

### RDS

Even though I like SQL for the ability to quickly run queries for data analysis,
I haven’t used any of the SQL databases. While researching for this article, I
found out that there is not a simple way to create an RDS instance using AWS SAM.
What a surprise! Check these out first if you’re interested in creating Aurora
instance – [1](https://gist.github.com/nathanmalishev/65b3f16c5acb0dc668453675b74298f3),
[2](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-aurora-serverless-data-api-sam/blob/master/deploy_scripts/rds_cfn_template.yaml).

## Things I haven’t used

There are many capabilities that I haven't used. In particular SQS, SNS, GraphQL,
Step Functions.

## Examples

If you ever get stuck, google it or search your case in the following resources:

- [Amazon’s Application Repository](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications)
- [Serverless App Examples](https://github.com/amazon-archives/serverless-app-examples/tree/master/javascript)

## Alternatives

### Terraform

It supports several cloud providers but a bit wordy and complex for me.

### Architect

Haven’t used it but heard good things.

## Conclusion

I used it briefly to construct some of the parts of larger systems but I think
AWS SAM is a great tool to run the whole project’s infrastructure.
